This is a simple code i wrote during the information theory course which demonstrates the working of arithematic coding.
The important things remaining in the code are:
1) Adding some GUI
2) Find some easy GUI for cpp and use it
3) Think  about applying arithematic coding practically to large files and compare the performance.
4) Create a wiki page of the code and explain the working of arithematic coding.
